# ⚖️ The Authority Translator (Open Source)

**Turn regulatory rage into compliance.**

> "The biggest risk in an audit isn't the documentation. It's the emotional response."

## 🎯 The Problem
We all know the feeling. An unjustified Non-Conformity. A reviewer who missed Page 5.
The impulse: Write an angry email.
The result: Escalation and delays.

## 🛠️ The Solution
This simple tool acts as a **"Diplomacy Filter"**. It takes your raw, unfiltered thoughts (e.g., *"The auditor is blind!"*) and translates them into perfect, diplomatic regulatory language suitable for:
* **US FDA** (Least Burdensome Approach)
* **EU Notified Bodies** (Cooperative, Evidence-based)
* **German Authorities / BfArM** (Formal "Behördendeutsch")

## 🚀 Features
* **Strategy Selector:** Choose between "Defend", "Apologize", "Clarify", or "Delay".
* **Tone Analysis:** Automatically removes sarcasm, aggression, and uncertainty.
* **Citation Injection:** Suggests where to insert references (e.g., [INSERT CAPA ID]).

## 🔒 Privacy First
This tool does **not** send your sensitive data to OpenAI via API.
It generates a **System Prompt** locally. You copy this prompt and paste it into your own secure Enterprise LLM (Copilot/ChatGPT Enterprise). Your data never leaves your control.

## 📦 How to Run
1. Clone the repo.
2. Install Streamlit: `pip install streamlit`
3. Run: `streamlit run app.py`
