## 🎯 The Problem
We all know the feeling. An unjustified Non-Conformity. A reviewer who missed Page 5.
The impulse: Write an angry email.
The result: Escalation and delays.

## 🛠️ The Solution
This tool acts as a **"Diplomacy Filter"**. It takes your raw, unfiltered thoughts (e.g., *"The auditor is blind!"*) and generates the **System Prompt** to translate them into perfect, diplomatic regulatory language suitable for:
* **US FDA** (Least Burdensome Approach)
* **EU Notified Bodies** (Cooperative, Evidence-based)
* **German Authorities / BfArM** (Formal "Behördendeutsch")

## 🔒 Privacy & Security (Important!)
This is a **Client-Side Application** (HTML/JS).
* **Zero Data Transfer:** Your input text **never** leaves your browser.
* **No API Calls:** The tool generates a prompt locally. You copy this prompt and paste it into your own secure Enterprise LLM (Copilot/ChatGPT Enterprise).
* **Auditable:** You can inspect the source code (`index.html`). It is less than 100 lines of plain text.

## 📦 Offline Use (Optional)
If you work in a high-security air-gapped environment:
1. Download the `index.html` file from this repository.
2. Disconnect from the internet.
3. Open `index.html` in Chrome/Edge.
4. It works perfectly.
