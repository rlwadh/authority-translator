**Turn regulatory rage into compliance. Instantly.**

> "The biggest risk in an audit isn't the documentation. It's the emotional response."

## 🎯 The Problem
We all know the feeling. An unjustified Non-Conformity. A reviewer who missed Page 5.
The impulse: Write an angry email.
The result: Escalation and delays.

## 🛠️ The Solution
This tool acts as a **"Diplomacy Filter"**. It takes your raw, unfiltered thoughts (e.g., *"The auditor is blind!"*) and uses AI to rewrite them into perfect, diplomatic regulatory language suitable for:
* **US FDA** (Least Burdensome Approach)
* **EU Notified Bodies** (Cooperative, Evidence-based)
* **German Authorities / BfArM** (Formal "Behördendeutsch")

## 🚀 How to use
**No installation. No API Key required.**
1. 👉 [**Click here to open the Tool**](https://rlwadh.github.io/authority-translator/)
2. Type your angry draft.
3. Click "Translate Now".
4. The AI (via Pollinations.ai) rewrites it instantly.
